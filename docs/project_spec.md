Overview of the MVP Application
The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) application is designed to provide users with a simple yet functional platform to create and customize pages using a library of SaaS components. It includes a default dashboard, a SaaS components library page, and the ability to create new pages. For this MVP, we will focus on enabling users to build two specific pages: an Active Task Page and a List of Leads Page.

Pages and Features
1. Default Dashboard
Purpose: Serves as the entry point for users when they first log into the application.
Features:
A welcoming interface that provides an overview and access to core functionalities.
Includes a Settings Menu with a Profile Page.
Profile Page: Allows users to view and manage their personal information (e.g., name, email, etc.).
2. SaaS Components Library Page
Purpose: Acts as a centralized hub where users can browse and select reusable components to build their pages.
Features:
Displays a list of all available SaaS components (e.g., Layout, Data Table, Form, Button, Text, Image).
Users can explore component options and choose them for use in their custom pages.
3. Page Creation and Customization
Purpose: Empowers users to create and design their own pages within the dashboard.
Features:
Users can create new pages directly from the dashboard.
Add components from the SaaS components library to these pages.
Arrange and customize components to meet their specific needs (e.g., configuring properties like data sources, fields, or styling).
Focus of the MVP: Two Specific Pages
For this MVP, we will prioritize building the features and components necessary for users to create the following two pages:

A. Active Task Page
Description: A detailed view of a single lead or task.
Features:
Displays profile details (e.g., name, contact info), task attributes (e.g., status, priority), and action buttons (e.g., "Complete Task," "Edit").
Users can customize the page by:
Adding more actions (e.g., extra buttons).
Including additional task attributes (e.g., due date, notes).
Key Components:
Layout Component: Structures the page and organizes other components.
Form Component: Allows dynamic input fields for task attributes.
Button Component: Adds clickable actions.
Text Component: Displays configurable text (e.g., task details).
Image Component: Shows profile pictures or related images.
B. List of Leads Page
Description: A summary view of multiple leads in a table or list format.
Features:
Displays key information about each lead (e.g., name, status, last updated).
Includes navigation options (e.g., clickable rows or buttons) to access the Active Task Page for a specific lead.
Key Components:
Layout Component: Arranges the list or table structure.
Data Table Component: Displays the list of leads in a tabular format.
Button Component: Enables navigation or actions (e.g., "View Details").
Text Component: Shows lead summaries with customizable styling.
Summary of Capabilities
User Workflow:
Enter the Default Dashboard and access the Profile Page via the settings menu.
Visit the SaaS Components Library Page to browse available components.
Create a new page and add components to build either the Active Task Page or List of Leads Page.
Customization: Users can configure component properties (e.g., data fields, styles, behaviors) to tailor the pages to their needs.
Focus: The MVP is streamlined to support only these two pages, ensuring a functional and efficient CRM-building experience.
This MVP provides a solid foundation for users to create a simple CRM application, with flexibility and scalability for future enhancements. Let me know if you'd like to refine any details!
